		<h1>Receptor Roullette</h1>
        <p>This game illustrates T Cell specification.</p>
        <p>Three types of cells will be presented on the screen.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Functional "killer" T Cells</strong>; these bind to <em>MHC I</em> (thanks to their CD8 co-receptors) and recognize a specific peptide.</li>
                <li><strong>Functional "helper" T Cells</strong>; these bind to <em>MHC II</em> instead of MHC I (since they have CD4 co-receptors, not CD8) and still recognize a specific peptide.</li>
                <li><strong>Double negative T Cells</strong>; these are nonfunctional, having neither CD8 nor CD4 co-receptors.</li>
                <li><strong>An antigen presenting cell</strong>; this cell represents any number of cells a T Cell might come across with MHC I displaying a peptide on its surface.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>During T Cell maturation, several things happen.
            <ul>
                <li>Killer T Cells are tested for peptide specificity by binding to MHC I on a professional APC.</li>
                <li>Helper T Cells are treated the same, but with an MHC II APC. There is no such APC in the game.</li>
                <li>Apoptosis is induced in double negative T Cells.</li>
            </ul>
            Mirror this process in the game as quickly as you can! (Hints: double tap a cell to induce apoptosis; we are only using one APC, so there will be more cells than you'll be able to deal with, but don't worry because this won't affect your score.)
        </p>
        <p>Some things to think about once you enter the game:
            <ul>
                <li>Where is the APC?</li>
                <li>Which cells are killer T Cells?</li>
                <li>Which cells are helper T Cells?</li>
                <li>Which cells are double negative?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
